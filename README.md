## About Me

Hi, I am Alejo, a final-year student in the Dual Bachelorâ€™s Degree program in Data Science and Engineering and Telecommunications Engineering at UC3M (University Carlos III of Madrid), part of the first class in this innovative and challenging degree. This English-taught program offers a broad, interdisciplinary approach, allowing me to build a solid foundation across data science, telecommunications, and cloud computing.

Since starting my journey in cloud technologies, I've had the privilege of gaining hands-on experience as a Data Engineer Intern with @Devoteam, a @Google Cloud partner. This role has provided the chance to work with tools like Vertex AI, BigQuery or AutoML and to see their applications in real-world projects. Pursuing certifications has further improved my understanding of Cloud Architecture and Security, and I am eager to continue learning in this field.

In addition to technology, I have a longstanding passion for cars and motorsport, especially Formula 1, which has inspired some of my projects. My approach is methodical, and I aim to bring strategic thinking to my work, alongside a desire to keep learning and contributing to my team.

Motivated to grow within the fields of cloud computing, data science, and telecommunications, I am committed to working hard, learning continuously, and collaborating as a team.
